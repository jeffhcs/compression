# compression

Source code for our project "Dual-Autoencoders for Facial Feature Preservation in
Image Compression".

### Running instructions

All the project code,
except for the bounding box generation,
can be found in `Project_Runnable.ipynb`.

- This notebook includes a link to a Google Drive folder containing our trained model with various configurations.

For a clearer and more readable version of the notebook, please refer to `Project_Runnable_Annotated.ipynb`. We recommend using this version for better understanding. Please note, however, that it was uploaded after the project deadline and is therefore optional.

The code for generating the bounding box using MTCNN
can be found in `boxes/boxes.ipynb` and `boxes/data.ipynb`.
